Notes:
- The total cost for the scalar subqery is much higher than the join equivalent: 25455 vs 68.44
- This is because SQL sees 880 rows, and with a scalar subquery, the subquery is evaluated for every row processed in the outer select. So the top end of the cost range that SQL estimates is 880 x subquery cost
- In contrast, the cost estimate for the join statement is much lower at 68.44
- However, in actual execution, the scalar subquery only executes 6 times for 6 rows, and as a result we see a total query time of 0.229
- In contrast, the actual query time for the join statement is 0.418. This is because there is a lot of overhead in setting up the hash table that's needed when we join in the bids table on the right. 
- To summarize, the scalar subquery has very little setup cost and potentially very high execution cost because it could theoretically loop through all rows identifiedâ€”880 of them. But in actuality only 6 loops were required in this query, and so only 6 iterations of the very fast subquery was performed. In contrast, the join query has lower theoretical max execution cost, but a much higher setup cost due to the need to create a hash table to store the table we are joining in.
